# World Model v1 Spec (First-Principles + Recursive Evolution)

## Why v1

`v0` solved structure description.  
`v1` adds causal depth: every key event must be mapped to first-principles variables and recursive transmission paths.

## First-Principles Variables

- `Capability`: what tasks become possible
- `Controllability`: how reliably outputs can be constrained/edited
- `Reliability`: how trustworthy and reproducible outcomes are
- `Distribution`: how efficiently capability reaches users/workflows
- `CostLatency`: compute and interaction cost over time

## Mandatory Output Blocks Per Cycle

1. **What happened (facts only)**
2. **Mechanism mapping** (which variable changed and how)
3. **Structural transmission** (1st-order, 2nd-order, 3rd-order effects)
4. **System position** (`Patch` / `Inflection` / `InfrastructureShift`)
5. **Evidence constraints** (what is still unknown)

## Data Binding

- Verified source of truth: `data/wiki/fact_wiki.csv`
- Company knowledge: `data/wiki/company_wiki.csv`
- Funding/M&A: `data/wiki/funding_ma_wiki.csv`
- Unresolved items: `data/wiki/pending_verification.csv`

## Non-Negotiables

- No speculative claims in core wiki.
- No inference without evidence.
- Unverified items stay outside the objective layer.

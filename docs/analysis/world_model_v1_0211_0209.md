# World Model v1 (First-Principles, 2026-02-11 → 2026-02-09)

> Data basis: `data/wiki/fact_wiki.csv` (verified-only objective facts)

## 1) What happened (facts)

- Multi-modal model and tool releases accelerated in parallel (image, speech, coding, video).
- Protocol/connectivity layer actions appeared across multiple stacks (`MCP`, `skills`, `OpenAPI`, `WebMCP`).
- Distribution surfaces converged (`Chat`, `IDE`, `Desktop` workflows).
- Capital actions validated infrastructure value (`Entire` funding, `Runway` funding, `Nebius→Tavily` acquisition).

## 2) Mechanism mapping (first principles)

## A. Capability
- Qwen-Image-2.0, MOSS-TTS, LLaDA2.1, HY-1.8B-2Bit, Composer 1.5, Sora Extensions
- Mechanism: generation-only systems evolve into generation+editing+workflow-aware systems.

## B. Controllability
- Seedream Preview (controllable editing path), Sora Extensions continuation logic, model editing unification
- Mechanism: shifts from “best-effort output” to “constraint-respecting production behavior.”

## C. Reliability
- Responses API task tooling, protocolized integrations, trend-report and engineering tooling updates
- Mechanism: reliability moves from model internals to system interfaces and operational control points.

## D. Distribution
- GPT-5.3-Codex expansion across third-party IDE channels; desktop agent surfaces (WorkBuddy, Claude Cowork)
- Mechanism: capability advantage only compounds when attached to high-frequency workflow entrances.

## E. CostLatency
- HY-1.8B-2Bit and similar efficiency pathways
- Mechanism: lower unit cost broadens deployable scope and increases iteration frequency.

## 3) Recursive transmission chain

`Model capability jump`
→ `workflow integration pressure`
→ `protocolization (MCP/skills/API)`
→ `distribution control competition`
→ `capital consolidation of critical modules`
→ `organizational operating model change`

This chain is already observable within the 3-day window via verified events.

## 4) System position tags

- `Patch`: isolated feature additions that do not change cross-layer behavior.
- `Inflection`: actions that alter how layers connect (e.g., protocol and distribution link-up).
- `InfrastructureShift`: actions that reallocate long-term control points (e.g., acquisition of verification/search modules).

Current window shows:
- Capability upgrades: mostly `Inflection`
- Protocol/connectivity actions: `Inflection` moving toward `InfrastructureShift`
- M&A around agentic verification: `InfrastructureShift`

## 5) Evidence constraints (strict objective mode)

- Items from non-official media/social accounts remain in `data/wiki/pending_verification.csv`.
- Founder/investor fields are only populated when explicitly evidenced.
- No unverified rumor enters objective wiki tables.

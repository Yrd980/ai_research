# Objective Writing Policy

This wiki accepts factual, source-backed descriptions only.

## Rules

- Use neutral statements (who/what/when/where).
- Avoid evaluative wording (e.g., "top", "best", "amazing").
- Every non-trivial intro or claim should have a source link in the page `Sources` section.
- If a fact is unknown, keep `TBD` rather than guessing.

## Compression Axioms (v1)

- Evidence-first: no source, no assertion.
- One-fact-one-assertion: split compound claims into atomic assertions.
- Normalize-before-add: merge synonyms/aliases before adding new entities.
- Reversible compression: each assertion must trace back to source/date.
- Time as first-class: key assertions should carry `event_date`.

## Intro Standard

Use this format for intros:
- `Objective Intro`: one factual sentence.
- Add at least one supporting source URL under `Sources`.

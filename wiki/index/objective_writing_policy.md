# Objective Writing Policy

This wiki accepts factual, source-backed descriptions only.

## Rules

- Use neutral statements (who/what/when/where).
- Avoid evaluative wording (e.g., "top", "best", "amazing").
- Every non-trivial intro or claim should have a source link in the page `Sources` section.
- If a fact is unknown, keep `TBD` rather than guessing.

## Intro Standard

Use this format for intros:
- `Objective Intro`: one factual sentence.
- Add at least one supporting source URL under `Sources`.
